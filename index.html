                    I currently work as an ontologist. I've done work on health-care applications, neuro-symbolic AI, natural language processing, and general data design.
                    In August 2020, I received a PhD in philosophy from the <a href="https://philosophy.nd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Notre Dame</a>. My dissertation,
                    <em style="font-weight: 500;">The Algebraic Structure of Propositions</em>, applied some general algebraic tools to questions about propositions and propositional attitudes. My dissertation was co-advised by <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/" target="_blank">Jeff Speaks</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/professordanielnolan/" target="_blank">Daniel Nolan</a>. Before coming to Notre Dame, I completed a B.A. in philosophy at <a href="https://college.lclark.edu/departments/philosophy/" target="_blank">Lewis & Clark College</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    In philosophy, my primary research interests are in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind, with a particular focus on the metaphysics of content and the metaphysics of conscious experience. Some other recent topics I have thought about are the principle of sufficient reason,
                    the problem of the unity of the proposition, the epistemic value of naturalness, and the relationship between representational content and symmetries in the context of scientific modeling.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of philosophy, I enjoy watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/geoffreyhall/" target="_blank">movies</a>, dabbling in maths, biking, and (occasionally) skateboarding. You can view my <strong>CV</strong> <a href="Hall CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Some further information can also be found on my Phil People <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/geoffrey-hall" target="_blank">profile</a>.
