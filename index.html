<p>I'm a fifth year graduate student in the philosophy department at the <a href="https://philosophy.nd.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Notre Dame </a>. 
You can view my cv <a href="Hall CV.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.<p>
				
<p> My primary research interests are in metaphysics and the philosophy of perception. I have recently finished writing 
	a dissertation titled <i>The Algebraic Structure of Propositions</i> in which I explore the relationship
	between various issues in metaphysics and questions of propositional fineness of grain. My advisors are 
	<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/" target="_blank"> Jeff Speaks</a> and 
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/professordanielnolan/" target="_blank"> Daniel Nolan </a>. Much of my recent work in metaphysics
	has related to questions of propositional fineness of grain. In the philosophy of perception I am primarily interested
	in questions concerning the metaphysics of phenomenal properties. I have additional interests in the philosophy of logic and math.<p>

<p id="abstract1" style="display:none">
The principle of sufficient reason threatens modal collapse. 
Some have suggested that by appealing to the indefinite extensibility of contingent truth, 
the threat is neutralized. This paper argues that this is not so. If the indefinite extensibility 
of contingent truth is developed in an analogous fashion to the most promising models of the 
indefinite extensibility of the concept set, plausible principles permit the derivation of modal collapse.

<h2>Under Review</h2>   
	<ul>
	<li> On the metaphysics of form. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract2') ">abstract</a> :
		<a href="TTOF.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>

<p id="abstract2" style="display:none">
Fine (2017) presents a puzzle of logical form and develops a solution based on his theory of arbitrary objects. 
This paper begins by reformulating Fine's puzzle as a "no-go theorem" in the context of abstract algebra. 
It then explores the space of theories of form in light of this puzzle. Two theories hold particular interest. 
One is naturally interpreted as a development of Fine's own theory. The other is novel, but bears an intimate 
connection to Fine's theory. The costs and benefits of each theory are explored.
</p>
	<li> On representation and the unity of the proposition. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract3') ">abstract</a> :
	<a href="UAA.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>
			
<p id="abstract3" style="display:none">
Propositions represent the entities from which they are formed. 
This fact has puzzled philosophers and some have put forward radical 
proposals in order to explain it. This paper develops a primivitist 
account of the representational properties of propositions that centers 
on the operation of application. As we will see, this theory wins out over 
its competitors on grounds of strength, systematicity and unifying power.
</p>

	<li> On phenomenal properties. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract4') ">abstract</a> :
		<a href="PPALP.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>

<p id="abstract4" style="display:none">
A property is phenomenal if and only if there is something that it is like to
have it. A property is consistent if and only if it fails to entail every property. 
A property is luminous if and only if having that property entails knowing that you have it. 
I argue that phenomenal properties are all and only the consistent luminous properties.

<li> On structure and the aim of belief. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract6') ">abstract</a> :
		<a href="SAB.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>

<p id="abstract6" style="display:none">
Recently several authors have argued that structure or joint-carvingness is an aim of belief. This paper argues that this is false.
In particular, I argue that our theorizing about the relative naturalness of properties is not itself guided by relative 
naturalness.

<h2>In Preparation</h2>  
	<ul>
	<li> On the unity of consciousness. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract7') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract7" style="display:none">
This paper argues that the best explanation of the unity of consciousness is to 
be found in the principle that perceptual experience agglomerates: if one exes 
that p and one exes that q then one exes that p and q. The background metaphysics 
is intentionalist: the principle that perceptual experience is a propositional attitude. 
Several other intentionalist and non-intentionalist explanations are considered and argued against.
</p>
	<li> On sensible properties and relations. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract8') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract8" style="display:none">
Perceptual atomism is the view that the representation of sensible properties is more fundamental than
the representation of sensible relations. This view is often contrasted with perceptual structuralism: the view that the 
representation of sensible relations is more fundamental than the representation of sensible properties. This paper argues 
that the existence of phenomenal continua shows that both atomism and structuralism are false. The representation of 
sensible relations is modally independent of the representation of sensible properties. 
</p>
	<li> On size and cardinality. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract9') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract9" style="display:none">
Recently several authors have argued against the orthodox view that the size of a set is its cardinality. This 
paper addresses the question of the relation of size and cardinality from a category theoretic perspective. It 
is argued that while it is correct to conclude that Cantor's theorem has nothing in particular to do with size,
there is nevertheless a plausible, broadly structuralist, justification for identifying size and cardinality.
</p>
	<li> On the limits of representation.
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract10') ">[abstract]</a></li>
<p id="abstract10" style="display:none">
This paper argues for the thesis that necessarily not every property of individuals is the content of an individual
representational vehicle. It does so by formulating a higher-order analogue of Lawvere's fixed point theorem. It is
then argued that despite this limitation on representation, we can nevertheless consistently maintain that that 
conditions which deliver the same proposition when applied to representational vehicles are identical. Thus 
while there are properties not represented, we can consistently suppose that they do not distinguish between any 
higher-order properties.
</p>
	<li> On propositional and objectual attitudes.
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract11') ">[abstract]</a></li>
<p id="abstract11" style="display:none">
This paper defends and clarifies propositionalism: the the thesis that all attitudes are definable in terms
of propositional attitudes.
