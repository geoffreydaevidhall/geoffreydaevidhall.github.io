                <p align="justify">I am currently an Ontological Engineer at <a href="https://cyc.com/" target="_blank">Cycorp</a>, where I 
                work on using higher-order logic to formalize common sense heuristics and inference patterns in addition to working on automated natural language processing. In August 2020 I received a PhD in philosophy from the <a href="https://philosophy.nd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Notre Dame</a>. My dissertation, <em style="font-weight: 500;">The Algebraic Structure of Propositions</em>, applied some general algebraic tools to questions about propositions and propositional attitudes.
                My dissertation was co-advised by <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/" target="_blank">Jeff Speaks</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/professordanielnolan/" target="_blank">Daniel Nolan</a>. Before coming to Notre Dame I completed a B.A. in philosophy at <a href="https://college.lclark.edu/departments/philosophy/" target="_blank" >Lewis & Clark College</a>. 
                <br><br>
                In philosophy, my primary research interests are in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics, with a particular focus on the the metaphysics of content and the metaphysics of conscious experience. I have additional interests in many areas of philosophy, however. Some other recent topics I have thought about are the principle of sufficient reason (<a href="IEPSR.pdf" target="_blank">Indefinite Extensibility and the Principle of Sufficient Reason</a>), the problem of the unity of the proposition (<a href="Unity and Application (Preprint).pdf" target="_blank">Unity and Application)</a> and the the epistemic value of naturalness (<a href="NAB.pdf" target="_blank">Naturalness is Not an Aim of Belief</a>) among other things. 
                <br><br>
                Outside of philosophy, I enjoy watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/geoffreyhall/" target="_blank">movies</a>, dabbling in maths, biking and (occasionally) skateboarding. You can view my <strong>CV</strong> <a href="Hall CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
