	<h1>Geoffrey Hall</h1>

<p>I'm a Postdoctoral fellow in the philosophy department at the <a href="https://philosophy.nd.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Notre Dame </a>. 
You can view my cv <a href="Hall CV.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.<p>
				
<p> My primary research interests are in metaphysics and the philosophy of perception. In metaphysics my current focus has been
	on the metaphysics of propositions. My sympathies lie with the view that propositions form a Boolean algebra under the operations
	of conjunction and negation, and much of my recent work has been directed on developing and defending this view. I completed 
	a dissertation titled <i>The Algebraic Structure of Propositions</i> at Notre Dame under the advisement of 
	<a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/" target="_blank"> Jeff Speaks</a> and 
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/professordanielnolan/" target="_blank"> Daniel Nolan </a> exploring these topics.
	In the philosophy of perception I am primarily concerned with the metaphysics of phenomenal properties, though I am also working out some views on
	the epistemology of perception. Finally, I have additional interests in the philosohy of math and logic. Some of my recent research in
	these areas has focused on the nature of arbitrary objects, and the explanatory role of algebra and category theory. <p>

<p id="abstract1" style="display:none">
The principle of sufficient reason threatens modal collapse. 
Some have suggested that by appealing to the indefinite extensibility of contingent truth, 
the threat is neutralized. This paper argues that this is not so. If the indefinite extensibility 
of contingent truth is developed in an analogous fashion to the most promising models of the 
indefinite extensibility of the concept set, plausible principles permit the derivation of modal collapse.

<h2>Under Review</h2>   
	<ul>
		<li> On propositional fineness of grain. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract2') ">abstract</a> :
		<a href="Booleanism and Belief.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>

<p id="abstract2" style="display:none">
Booleanism is the thesis that the set of propositions forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of 
conjunction and negation. If Booleanism is true, then belief distributes over conjunction if and only if it is 
closed under entailment. Some authors have rejected Booleanism on this basis. I argue that we ought to reject 
the thesis that belief distributes over conjunction.

	<li> On the metaphysics of form. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract2') ">abstract</a> :

<p id="abstract2" style="display:none">
Fine (2017) presents a puzzle of logical form and develops a solution based on his theory of arbitrary objects. 
This paper begins by reformulating Fine's puzzle as a "no-go theorem" in the context of abstract algebra. 
It then explores the space of theories of form in light of this puzzle. Two theories hold particular interest. 
One is naturally interpreted as a development of Fine's own theory. The other is novel, but bears an intimate 
connection to Fine's theory. The costs and benefits of each theory are explored.

	<li> On representation and the unity of the proposition. (R&R)
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract3') ">abstract</a> :
	<a href="UAA.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>
			
<p id="abstract3" style="display:none">
Propositions represent the entities from which they are formed. 
This fact has puzzled philosophers and some have put forward radical 
proposals in order to explain it. This paper develops a primivitist 
account of the representational properties of propositions that centers 
on the operation of application. As we will see, this theory wins out over 
its competitors on grounds of strength, systematicity and unifying power.

	<li> On phenomenal properties. 
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract4') ">abstract</a> :
		<a href="PPALP.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>

<p id="abstract4" style="display:none">
A property is phenomenal if and only if there is something that it is like to
have it. A property is consistent if and only if it fails to entail every property. 
A property is luminous if and only if having that property entails knowing that you have it. 
I argue that phenomenal properties are all and only the consistent luminous properties.

<li> On structure and the aim of belief. (R&R)
	[<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract6') ">abstract</a> :
		<a href="SAB.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>]</li>

<p id="abstract6" style="display:none">
Recently several authors have argued that structure or joint-carvingness is an aim of belief. This paper argues that this is false.
In particular, I argue that our theorizing about the relative naturalness of properties is not itself guided by relative 
naturalness.

<h2>In Preparation</h2>  
	<ul>
	<li> On the unity of consciousness. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract7') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract7" style="display:none">
This paper argues that the best explanation of the unity of consciousness is to 
be found in the principle that perceptual experience agglomerates: if one exes 
that p and one exes that q then one exes that p and q. The background metaphysics 
is intentionalist: the principle that perceptual experience is a propositional attitude. 
Several other intentionalist and non-intentionalist explanations are considered and argued against.
</p>
	<li> On whether 'phenomenally conscious' is vague. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract8') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract8" style="display:none">
This paper defends the thesis that possibly something is such that it is borderline whether
it is phenomenally conscious. Consciousness is vague. There are a number of arguments
that purport to show the opposite view that consciousness is precise. I argue that these
arguments depend on principles that are inconsistent with plausible, and somewhat
standard, principles governing the notion of a borderline case.  
</p>
	<li> On size and cardinality. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract9') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract9" style="display:none">
Recently several authors have argued against the orthodox view that the size of a set is its cardinality. This 
paper addresses the question of the relation of size and cardinality from a category theoretic perspective. It 
is argued that while it is correct to conclude that Cantor's theorem has nothing in particular to do with size,
there is nevertheless a plausible, broadly structuralist, justification for identifying size and cardinality.
</p>
	
	<li> On propositional and objectual attitudes.
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract11') ">[abstract]</a></li>
<p id="abstract11" style="display:none">
This paper defends and clarifies propositionalism: the the thesis that all attitudes are definable in terms
of propositional attitudes.
