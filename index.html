<p>I'm a fifth year graduate student in the philosophy department at the <a href="https://philosophy.nd.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Notre Dame </a>. 
You can view my cv <a href="Hall CV.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.<p>
				
<p>My primary research interests are in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind. 
In metaphysics I have recently been interested in questions concerning how fine-grained propositions, 
properties and relations are. In my dissertation, I defend and explore the position <em>Booleanism</em>, 
which says, roughly, that propositions, properties and relations are no more fine-grained than classical logical equivalence. 
My current research in the philosophy of mind has concerned the metaphysics of consciousness.<p>
				
<p>I have additional interests in the philosophy of logic and math. 
One issue I have been thinking about recently is arbitrary object 
theory and the potential for bringing in category theoretic tools in developing it.<p>

<p id="abstract1" style="display:none">
The principle of sufficient reason threatens modal collapse. 
Some have suggested that by appealing to the indefinite extensibility of contingent truth, 
the threat is neutralized. This paper argues that this is not so. If the indefinite extensibility 
of contingent truth is developed in an analogous fashion to the most promising models of the 
indefinite extensibility of the concept set, plausible principles permit the derivation of modal collapse.

<h2>Under Review</h2>   
	<ul>
	<li> On the metaphysics of form. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract5') ">[abstract]</a></li>

<p id="abstract5" style="display:none">
Fine (2017) presents a puzzle of logical form and develops a solution based on his theory of arbitrary objects. 
This paper begins by reformulating Fine's puzzle as a "no-go theorem" in the context of abstract algebra. 
It then explores the space of theories of form in light of this puzzle. Two theories hold particular interest. 
One is naturally interpreted as a development of Fine's own theory. The other is novel, but bears an intimate 
connection to Fine's theory. The costs and benefits of each theory are explored.
</p>
	</ul>
	<li> On representation and the unity of the proposition. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract2') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract2" style="display:none">
Propositions represent the entities from which they are formed. 
This fact has puzzled philosophers and some have put forward radical 
proposals in order to explain it. This paper develops a primivitist 
account of the representational properties of propositions that centers 
on the operation of application. As we will see, this theory wins out over 
its competitors on grounds of strength, systematicity and unifying power.
</p>

	<li> On phenomenal properties. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract3') ">[abstract]</a></li>

<p id="abstract3" style="display:none">
A property is phenomenal if and only if there is something that it is like to
have it. A property is consistent if and only if it fails to entail every property. 
A property is luminous if and only if having that property entails knowing that you have it. 
I argue that phenomenal properties are all and only the consistent luminous properties.

<h2>In Preperation</h2>  

	<li> On the unity of consciousness. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract4') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract4" style="display:none">
This paper argues that the best explanation of the unity of consciousness is to 
be found in the principle that perceptual experience agglomerates: if one exes 
that p and one exes that q then one exes that p and q. The background metaphysics 
is intentionalist: the principle that perceptual experience is a propositional attitude. 
Several other intentionalist and non-intentionalist explanations are considered and argued against.
</p>
	<li> On sensible properties and relations. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract4') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract4" style="display:none">
Perceptual atomism is the view that the representation of sensible properties is more fundamental than
the representation of sensible relations. Perceptual structuralism is the view that the reprsentation of 
sensible relations is more fundamental than the representation of sensible properties. Most authors have either adopted 
atomism or structuralism. This paper argues that the existence of phenomenal continua shows that both atomism and
structuralism are false. The representation of phenomenal relations is modally independent of the representation of 
phenomenal properties.
</p>
	<li> On size and cardinality. 
	<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick =" return toggleMe( 'abstract4') ">[abstract]</a></li>
			
<p id="abstract4" style="display:none">
Recently several authors have argued against the orthodox view that the size of a set is its cardinality. This 
paper addresses the question of the relation of size and cardinality from a category theoretic perspective. It 
is argued that while it is correct to conclude that Cantor's theorem has nothing in particular to do with size,
there is nevertheless a plausible, broadly structuralist, justification for identifying size and cardinality.
