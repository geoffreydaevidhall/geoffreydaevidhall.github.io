                <li class="blue"><em>Ethical Theory</em> (<a href="Ethical Theory Syllabus (Web).pdf" target="blank">Syllabus</a>):
                    This course is an introduction to the core issues in contemporary ethical theory. We will start by looking at the foundations of ethics. What is it for something to be morally good? What is it for an action to be obligatory? How do we know about morality? Does morality depend on God? We will then turn to competing theories of the general principles of morality. Do the ends justify the means? Are there actions that are forbidden no matter the consequences? Do individuals have rights? Is there an important moral distinction between doing something and letting it happen? Finally, with a good grasp on some of these more theoretical problems, we will turn to more applied questions: is animal consumption morally permissible? Is abortion morally permissible? What obligations do we have towards future generations? What obligations to we have towards those less fortunate than ourselves? Are there individuals or organizations that have special moral authority?</li>

                <!--<li class="blue"><em>The Philosophy of Time</em> (<a href="" target="blank">Syllabus</a>):
                    This course is an introduction to the philosophy time structured around the following four topics: the nature of time, our persistence through time, the logical possibility of time travel, and the relation between time and free action. <em>The nature of time</em>: Does time pass? Do past and future entities exist? Is the present special in some way, or is it on par with the past and the future. <em>Our persistence through time</em>: What is it for a thing to exist at more than one time? What is it for a person to exist at more than one time? Can we survive fission? Can we survive teletransporation? <em>The logical possibility of time travel:</em>: Is time travel inherently contradictory? What do the different theories of the nature of time say about the possibility of time travel? <em>Time and free action</em>: Is the future open? Or are the facts about the future already settled? If the future is settled, then how can we freely bring about certain states of aairs?</li>-->

                <li class="blue"><em>Modal Logic and Metaphysics</em> (<a href="Modal Logic and Metaphysics.pdf" target="blank">Syllabus</a>): 
                    This course is an introduction to modal logic, possible-world semantics, and associated philosophical issues. We will start by covering the basics of modal logic beginning with propositional modal logic and then moving on to quantified modal logic. After this, we delve into the philosophical controversies surrounding modal logic and modality. Topics to be covered include the nature of possible worlds, whether existence is necessary or contingent, the relationship between essence and modality, the epistemology of modality, and several other areas in addition.</li>

                <li class="blue"><em>Perceptual Experience</em> (<a href="Philosophy of Perception Syllabus (Web).pdf" target="blank">Syllabus</a>):
                    When subject to an illusion, a perceiver sees an object that is not the way it looks. In hallucination, a perceiver seems to see and object, despite there being no object there. These two facts look to conflict with an intuitive idea of perceptual experience as mere acquaintance with one's surroundings. This is the so called "problem of perception." This course will look at theories of the nature of perceptual experience and evaluate how well they fare with respect to the problem of perception (and other related problems).</li>
