                                What is the relation between how things are and the universals they instantiate? A traditional view says that things are how they are <em>because</em> of the universals that they instantiate.  Protons are positively charged when and because they instantiate the property of being charged.  A more recent alternative takes the explanation to go the other way.  Things instantiate the universals they do because of 
                                how they are.  Protons instantiate the property of being positively charged when and because they are positively charged. This paper defends a third alternative, inconsistent with both of these views.  On the view that I prefer,  what is is for things to be how they are is for them to instantiate the universals that they do.
                                What it is for a proton to be positively charged is for it to instantiate the universal of being positively charged.  I will argue that it is only by adopting this view that the realist can solve the <em>specification problem</em> concerning universals: roughly, the problem of explaining how it is that we manage to specify 
                                the universals that we do. I then respond to a number of criticisms of the view. In many cases, what may initially look like a problem for the view ends up in fact being a feature.

The background metaphysics is intentionalist, in that it adopts the thesis that experience is a propositional attitude.

                    <p> I have a number of different research interests in philosophy. A good deal of my work has been on the metaphysics of conscious experience and the ontology and grain of propositions, properties and relations. I'm specifically interested in exploring the consequences various metaphysical hypotheses in these areas have on other areas of philosophy, such as epistemology, vagueness and action theory. Recently I have been working on a couple of papers about the metaphysics of color which I hope to bring to finishing stages soon. Below are some brief notes on maths, philosophy of logic and philosophical logic.
